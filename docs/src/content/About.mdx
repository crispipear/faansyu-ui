# About

**This library is still under development and improvements**

**faanshu-ui** is a React ui library with easily integrated, reusable and customizable components.
Our primary goal is to create a kit that helps creators to build a variety of web applications
while maintaining design consistency, accessibility and minimal aethestics.

This started a side project outside of work/school, we wanted to turn those ui components into a dedicated design system
for our future projects and for other developers who are interested.

# Theme and styling

Set the theme of your ui with the theme provider. Pick from faanshu-ui preset themes or customize your own palette.

## Prerequisite

Make sure you have wrapped your app in the faanshu-ui provider.

See: [Getting started](./getting-started).

<!-- ## Preset themes

## Customized theme -->

## Color system
faanshu-ui theme colors help contextualizing colors for your UI to create hierachy and express branding.

### Variants
There are 8 types of color variants we use in a theme. 

See type: [Variant](./overview#Variant)

### Shades
Each color variant has 3 different shades: **main**, **light**, **dark**. These shades will apply to the UI components for extensive styling.
By default, the shades **light** and **dark** are generated based on the provided **main** value.
